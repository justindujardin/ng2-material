[![Sauce Test Status](https://saucelabs.com/browser-matrix/ng2material.svg)](https://saucelabs.com/u/ng2material)

This is an implementation of [Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/) components for Angular 2. It is meant to be a workable set of components that can be used until an official implementation is provided by Google. As the [angular/material2](https://github.com/angular/material2) components become more usable, this project will explore ways to migrate to the official implementation.

Check out the [examples site](https://justindujardin.github.io/ng2-material/) for demos and instructions on getting started.

## Getting Help

**IMPORTANT**: This project is provided as-is, and no commercial level of support is given to it. If you need perfect compatbility with IE or great getting started materials for your specific use-case, you may be better off waiting for an official release of material2.

That being said, if something is wrong with your installation or with the existing examples or materials, please try to provide a Plunkr example reproducing your problem, and file an issue.

## Credits

[Angular Material](https://github.com/angular/material) and [Angular 2](https://github.com/angular/angular) projects. 
Many of the components and examples are ported directly from their existing projects.
