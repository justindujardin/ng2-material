## Getting Help

**IMPORTANT**: This project is provided as-is, and no commercial level of support is given to it. If you need perfect compatbility with IE or great getting started materials for your specific use-case, you may be better off waiting for an official release of material2.

That being said, if something is wrong with your installation or with the existing examples or materials, please try to provide a Plunkr example reproducing your problem, and file an issue.
